This repository contains my work in Microsoft Excel.

This project consists of an excel dashboard on the  Bank Loan data.Concepts like Excel functions, Pivot Tables, Excel charts, etc were used in this. Along with the dashboard, it presents some business insights in a report.




##  Business Problem Reqirements

DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY

In order to monitor and assess our bank&#39;s lending activities and performance, we need to
create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key
loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven
decisions, track our loan portfolio health, and identify trends that can inform our lending
strategies.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

1. Total Loan Applications
2. Total Funded Amount
3. Total Amount Received
4. Average Interest Rate:
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)


Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI’s

In order to evaluate the performance of our lending activities and assess the quality of our
loan portfolio, we need to create a comprehensive report that distinguishes between Good Loan’s and Bad Loan’s based on specific loan status criteria

Good Loan KPIs:

1. Good Loan Application Percentage
2. Good Loan Applications
3. Good Loan Funded Amount
4. Good Loan Total Received Amount

Bad Loan KPIs:

1. Bad Loan Application Percentage
2. Bad Loan Applications
3. Bad Loan Funded Amount
4. Bad Loan Total Received Amount

Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the
performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by Loan Status. This
report will serve as a valuable tool for analysing and understanding the key indicators
associated with different loan statuses.

DASHBOARD 2: OVERVIEW
In our Bank Loan Report project, we aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics
and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful
view of our lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to
gain valuable insights into various loan parameters. Below are the specific chart
